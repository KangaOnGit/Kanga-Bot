# Discord-Bot
My discord bot, it's still updating


Bot link: https://discord.com/developers/applications/862205581862895686/information 

The bot is still being worked on, I'm taking a 1 week break to avoid burntouts. It's written in Python and is still really unoptimize right now. The bot doesn't have a host server so it's on whenever I'm on, check it out if you want.

When I've finished giving games similar to Pepe Bot or Ook Bot; I will upload the full guide: including source code, JSon files and inner-networkings.
